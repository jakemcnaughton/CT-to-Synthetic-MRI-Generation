# Synthetic Brain MRI Generation from CT Scans Using Deep Learning

This repository collates the models I developed for my masters thesis. The purpose of this development was to develop models that could accurately produce an MRI from a CT scan for suspected stroke patients. MRIs have specific benefits over CTs: they have better contrast and detail of soft tissue and lesions and registration of brain scans is often registered to an MRI atlas, making an MRI the preferable model to have available.
